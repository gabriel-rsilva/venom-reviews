the_review
I actually had a riot and enjoyed it.
"Where Ruben Fleischer's first film was bloated, unwieldy and incoherent, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, somewhat ironically, is simplified, more focused and even more intimate than its predecessor."
"Where the first Venom was toxically dull, Venom 2, at its best, is intoxicating."
"It makes no bones about being anything other than a silly comic book caper, but it puts in the effort in all the right places and even a few it didn't need to."
Too much carnage and not enough plot and characterization.
"Still massively dependent on CGI, it's definitely not for most grown-ups."
"Tom Hardy once again gives us a festival of gestures, drunken humor and an ability to laugh at himself through self-freezing that has not been done this well since Bruce Campbell in the Evil Dead. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"If you accept the whole thing as a brisk, scattershot B-movie among comic-book films, it's fun. But you are not obliged to be so lenient."
"Serkis dispenses with detailed explanations and instead amps up the humour, leaning into the goofy, flirtatious dynamic between Venom and Brock."
"That fierce kineticism has failed to coalesce into a quasi-coherent sequel. Venom 2 is certainly riotous, but where did the fun go?"
It took a bite out of my brain and soul. It belongs in the Idiocracy universe. The genre and its fans deserve better! [Full Review in Spanish]
If you can tolerate some daft fun and a movie full of knowing glances then you'll be just fine. It's not a particularly good movie but I did have a good time with it.
"""Happy being weird, at least giving the film some character when the storyline is too poorly executed to pick up the slack."""
"A love story written in blood, sweat and the slime of half-eaten brains."
The zany Eddie/Venom rapport compensates for the horribly written villains.
"It's not perfect, but it sure is fun."
"Hardy's game performance once again sells it; Eddie's hangdog schtick is nicely contrasted by the wild, slavering and puppyish enthusiasm of Venom."
Surely the character Tom Hardy has taken the least seriously in his entire career. [Full review in Spanish]
"Venom: Let There Be Crazy, Stupid Love isn't a great movie, but it doesn't matter because it's just big, dumb, romantic fun."
Fun but instantly forgettable.
It's time for Venom to hang up his... appendages?
Extraordinarily poor.
"The fact that there's no Oscar for Best Performance as a Dialectical Situation is a crime, but for the time being, let's let superhero movies be this weird on a consistent basis."
This is great fun.
"Even at a tight 97 minutes, it is clear that the comic book dream of having the iconic symbiotes face off was the goal - they just were not sure how to fill the time getting there."
This sequel delivers a silly and compelling love story between man and head-chomping alien symbiote. A tale as old as time.
"There's a little bit more polish this time, but for all the talented people involved,Let There Be Carnage still has the whiff of a turd in the wind."
This warped buddy movie sequel is let down by a threadbare plot.
"It's almost Raimi-esque in its treatment of body horror, and has its large, pointy tongue stuffed firmly in its cheek. But it's just not as sharp, and the action is more smudge than punch."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is refreshingly nuts, and benefits from being a whole 45 minutes shorter than its predecessor."
"While Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a bit predictable and messy in parts, it's also the romantic comedy of the year."
"Aside from a few laughs and some entertaining CGI punch ups, Venom 2 is, to be honest, a bit rubbish, and only slightly less so than its predecessor."
"Besides being nasty, the new movie is quite jokey. This wouldn't be a tonal issue if the jokes were good, but they're not."
Does Serkis succeed at delivering what we expect from a film like this? Yes. Does it begin to exit that box and give us something worth investing in? No.
"It's dumb. It's loud. It barely makes a lick of sense. But unlike its predecessor, this second cinematic outing for the popular Marvel antihero is also a heck of a lot of fun."
"Breaking up with someone can be traumatic, especially if the two people breaking up share the same body. That is one of the many funny, dramatic, odd things that happen in this Venom sequel."
"[Tom] Hardy's Eddie is a rather recessive leading man; mostly he's a serviceable straight man to Venom. But [Woody] Harrelson puts on an entertaining show as usual, and [Naomie] Harris is freaky and memorable."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage takes all the best bits of the first movie and leans fully into them. Of course, it also carries a lot of the same weaknesses, but this time around it knows exactly what to do with them."
"Instead of shoving this erotic mess into a suffocating superhero formula, the sci-fi buddy-comedy leans into everything that makes this concept such a bizarre blast to watch."
There is not much sense... but here everything feels like a carnival. [Full review in Spanish]
Does justice to its title. [Full review in Spanish]
A fun anomaly in this era of comic book cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is kind of a mess.
"It will no doubt appeal to Venom and Spidey fans, and maybe people who park in theaters that only validate for two hours."
"A bit too idiosyncratic to fit the [superhero] formula. It is both too brutal and too goofy. Now, this is not to say that it is too brutal and too goofy to be enjoyable, because here's the thing - this movie is fun. Surprisingly so, honestly."
"Andy Serkis is no stranger to the necessities of making a digital character feel tactile, and that shows in his direction."
"With Tom Hardy being involved in creating this story, it's unsurprising that he seems to be having a terrific time camping it up."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage has Venom fighting Carnage, and it delivers on that. Everything else just falls apart with the rushed editing, poor pacing, and bad dialogue."
"It's nice to be able to appreciate a superhero movie that understands how scary the world can be even if you have literal superpowers, and that there's something beautiful in not going it alone."
More superhero films should embrace the willful silliness that makes Venom: Let There Be Carnage one of the surprise charmers of the year.
"Audiences are clamoring for a fun, bizarre and messy time at the movies ; ""Venom; Let There Be Carnage"" delivers!"
"Proudly silly and almost charmingly trite, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a throwback to when comic book movies were unpretentious b-movie nonsense."
"It's a mix of the stupidly entertaining with the just plain stupid, a film that's partially superior to its predecessor, but frustratingly uninspiring.[Full review in Spanish]"
"A rare example of a studio realising what worked about the first film and leaning into it. Serkis' direction has streamlined the story, Hardy is now truly comfortable with these characters and they know that the humour is what needs dialling up to eleven."
Unusual to say the least...there is some deadpan humor to what it's doing...and I kind of enjoyed Tom Hardy...
The Venom franchise knows what it is and doesn't apologize for it.
"The script is certainly frustrating and the narrative not all that thrilling, but Venom has the good sense to deliver more of what audiences loved about the first film: the Eddie/Venom dynamic and hijinks."
Director Andy Serkis and writer Kelly Marcel... don't take anything seriously. [Full review in Spanish]
I was too turned off to get into how much fun it can be as simply a goof.
"Some movies are bad because they're so absurd, this franchise gets a pass precisely because it knows what it is and doesn't care."
What a waste of this great cast.
"erkis frees this film from the shackles of seriousness, which allows Venom's latest to reach its freakiest potential."
"A dispiriting waste of its screen talent, Let There Be Carnage evokes only one dominant thought as it unspools: let this be over."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a love story. Simple as that.
It's refreshing to have a movie as self-aware as this one.
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage ... isn't especially good, but the team is devoted to telling this very silly story."
"This is perfect B-movie trash. In an era where Marvel takes itself too seriously, we need more schlock like this."
"Tom Hardy knew what movie he was in in the first one, and now the rest of the movie does too. That consistency down the line offers some true bonkers fun, amongst the occasional eye rolling silliness."
...just not enough of a story to make any of this matter all that much.
"There is not much to sink your teeth into ... apart from some alien parasite humor, a lifeless love triangle (square, should you count the extraterrestrial leech) and the predictable, short-lived rise and fall of a formulaic villain."
"... wastes no time setting up escape sequences, showdowns, and bromance quarrels... delivers exactly what the previous mid-credit introduction of Woody Harrelson promised... and sometimes that's exactly enough."
The novelty factor is obviously no longer present and director Andy Serkis doesn't do anything remarkable enough with the new story or characters to make things interesting.
"Taking the franchise into the bickering couple route of light comedy and minimal story was, as they say, a choice. Not a good one, but a decisive one"
"Soon there are two alien symbiotes running amuck, Venom the black gooey one. Carnage the red gooey one with extra spikes and arms. When they meet in battle it's like a tornado in a licorice factory."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnagewill certainly not acquire any new fans. But if you bought into the messy magic of the first film, you will undoubtedly find much in which to revel with its successor."
"If 2018's Venom felt like an afterthought, then the sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, feels like an afterthought to an afterthought."
The appeal of what might otherwise read as genuine slapdash charm evaporates the moment it's once again apparent that it's not really all that genuine
"The visual bludgeoning that passes for a climactic battle, set during Cletus and Shriek's wedding, is essentially two CGI workstations fighting each other in a cathedral."
"This is the best rom-com I've seen this year thus far. If you can't beat 'em, Venom."
"The sequel to the 2018 Marvel spinoff might not be good, exactly, but everyone's having a lot more fun this time..."
There is so much to enjoy in Venom: Let There Be Carnage. It is a great film to waste a few hours and some concession money on.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage stands head and shoulders above its predecessor in every aspect. Its plotting is better. Its comedy is better. Even its action setpieces are better.
Carnage isn't just the bad guy in the movie. It describes the script.
I had a good time and I had a terrible time and I recommend it.
"Lazy, dull and unfunny. Yet another mindless, over-produced B-movie that's not nearly as fun or campy as it could've been."
"While I agree it's not the best movie, I had a wonderful time... It's like Sony went, ""Oh, I see. The first movie wasn't great but you guys liked the relationship between Venom and Eddie, so we'll just give you more of that!"""
"Before we can spend too much time with this song and dance, the plot mechanics kick into boisterous gear, despite neglecting to fully flesh out the pair of lovebird maniacs driving it."
"Effects dominate story: The real carnage, however, is inflicted on the screenplay."
The movie to me just feels a little unbalanced.
"With its goofball plotting and abbreviated run time, Let There Be Carnage often feels like a super-expensive B movie that has been quickly slapped together in order to get something in front of the cameras before contracts can expire."
"What you're left with is 90 minutes of pure slapstick tomfoolery, cartoonish violence, and a slam-bang pace that feels like you're watching a Looney Tunes short before the real feature begins."
Superhero movies as tiresome slapstick. Tom Hardy and his CGI counterpart do the Odd Couple thing in between occasional action scenes and Woody Harrelson mugging.
"Ultimately, with the lack of quality control on Venom: Let There Be Carnage, this movie feels like a mindless cash grab."
"This sequel is a violent, very sloppy, yet entertaining battle through couples counseling for Tom Hardy's Eddie and his symbiote."
The basic structure of the Venom series is in no way whatsoever conducive to good movies.
"So we've got interesting people playing interesting characters, but the movie doesn't give them anything particularly interesting to do..."
"There are many, many attempts at weaponizing their banter as comic gristle, but too often the jokes die on the vine, and there's precious little else to hold onto."
"A satisfying sequel to its 2018 predecessor. Carnage and Shriek are welcome additions to the franchise, though Shriek definitely deserved more screen time. The sleek visuals and amped up action sequences are the film's strongest elements."
"If you liked the first movie, you're going to love this sequel. And if you weren't totally sold on the original Venom, there's every chance you'll like this movie a lot more."
"It's breezy, yet bold; silly, yet compelling; a flurry of fuckery you won't want to miss. If you liked the first Venom, you'll enjoy his second outing just as much. After all, ""we are Venom"" and three years later, that's still rad as hell."
"In a world where super-powered protagonists are celebrated for their honorable heroism, Hardy's bumbling sincerity serves as a welcomed change of pace."
Just imagine Look Who's Talking starring Tom Hardy as the baby and Tom Hardy doing a Cookie Monster voice as Bruce Willis. Perfection.
"""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" never reaches the laugh-out-loud highs its narcissistic alien protagonist would assume and the much hyped climatic battle is muddled at best."
Serkis... seems to be trying to duplicate the energy of a kid tearing through a comic book.
"Hardy takes the opportunity to give a consistent, just-roll-with-it kind of performance. It certainly helps that Harrelson offers the perfect complementary performance laced with malevolence and more than a few laughs."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage feels like a lot of set-up for little pay-off.
"Hardy's ownership of Let There Be Carnage has had a clear impact, with the movie recapturing the electric character dynamic from the original, and getting to the off-kilter odd couple stuff far earlier."
"Look, I'm all in for these movies. Yes, this movie is so stupid! But that seems to be the point."
This is a ferociously fun movie with great performances and a nonstop sense of entertainment.
"he film manages to thread the needle between romantic comedy and superhero melodrama, even leaning into the literary kind of 'gothic.'"
"If you're looking for a great cross-species buddy-story, this isn't it. Hardy is both funny and lovable in a movie that is way too chaotic, but still screams, ""Sequel."""
"Clocking in at a trim 90 minutes, Let There Be Carnage is easily the shortest modern-day superhero movie. It's half an Endgame long! It's also half an Endgame good."
"It's cinematic fast food-tasty, but not at all nourishing."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a riotous CGI spectacle with superb action scenes and wicked humor. But the plot is razor thin and basic.
"Let There Be Carnage is certainly more fun than the average Marvel film, and thankfully absent the smugness of something like Deadpool."
"If you liked the first movie, you're going to love this sequel. And if you weren't totally sold on the original Venom, there's every chance you'll like this movie a lot more."
"Both the glimmering past and future overshadow this film, sinking their poison-tinged fangs into a disappointing present."
"There's almost no humanity to this film; it's all product. It's action figures in motion, a kind of rushed, shallow superhero film that we might have seen in the late 90s."
"A frothy, silly flick, full of gory hijinks and dumbster fun. Let the slapstick continue."
A colossal waste of talent in front of the camera and not exactly a resume builder behind it.
"Again, the Venom franchise leans into the whimsical mayhem that will divide outlooks. The commitment of Tom Hardy is the pillar that keeps in on track."
"If your appetite for superhero films is starting to wane, Venom Let There Be Carnage will put a tight lid on it for you. It's like closing your eyes and listening to a car crash on repeat for 90 minutes."
"You come out of it feeling as though you've been bludgeoned for ninety minutes with mugging, mayhem, mindlessness and mediocre CGI."
This isn't a Venom for everyone. But it most definitely is the Venom for everyone who applauded Hardy's take the last time around.
"""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" commits many of the same sins as the original movie...and will likely still click with Marvel fans."
"The buddy relationship between Venom and Eddie is bizarre, random and hilarious."
Venom: There Will Be Carnage' is serviceable and far from toxic.
"The main attraction is Tom Hardy's hilarious and endearing performance in the buddy comedy, but on the superhero front, the Venom sequel doesn't live up to the title. Michelle Williams and Naomi Harris are wasted as side pieces to the two male leads."
"For a superhero film in 2021, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is refreshing for its willingness to be nothing more than silly, fun, and fleeting."
"Serkis makes it work for the most part, providing an enjoyable ride of bizarre events and frenzied showdowns, striving to preserve the controlled chaos of The Venom Experience."
"By fully embracing the better elements of the original (goofy humor and Eddie/Venom duo), Andy Serkis and company deliver a tighter, fun sequel. [Full review in Spanish]"
The things this movie gets away with thanks to that bizarrely delightful Eddie/Venom relationship ...
Does what good sequels do and leans into what made the first movie work: the performance of Tom Hardy and the characters of Venom & Eddie Brock.
Venom 2 a damn good night out...
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is tied with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance as the worst movie to ever have the Marvel name attached to it.
"Harrelson and Harris are fun, but everything else is pretty underwhelming."
The Brock/Venom hero is an off-axis bizarre manifestation whose ever-increasing strangeness only endears him more with the viewer. Venom has a loveable quality by the closing moments that should cement his presence in several projects to come.
"Andy Serkis keeps the rambunctious proceedings relatively taut, making room for operatic action and a sneaky emotional undercurrent that pokes through the broad comedy and comic-book grandeur."
"The result is a mish-mash of messy, frenetic fun with a higher body count than you might expect."
"As infected as the original with unbearable dialogue and a predictable, uninteresting plot"
"To its perverse credit, Venom 2, as it's being called, manipulates its audience with all the tentacles it can deploy, most of them cheerfully ridiculous."
"The viewing experience is like going to a nightclub and having someone scream the plot in your ear over a thumping bass line -- ironic, given that Venom's biggest weakness is sound waves."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is even worse than the dog of a film that was the original. I'd love to say that this is the last we'll see of the character, but an end credits teaser strongly hints at a return very soon."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is like the 2018 Venom movie on meth: It's filled with loud scatter-brained nonsense, gibberish dialogue, and repetitive hyperactivity--resulting in one giant, annoying headache."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a torturously bad watch from beginning to end
"It is mostly noisy and flimsy and without purpose, a hasty response to the original's unexpected success and little else. Naturally a third film is advertised at the end."
The sequel to Venom is a jumbled mess made up of random ideas plopped together in a 90-minute package.
"This is, in essence, a slapstick blood bath about two threesomes both in desperate need of throuples therapy."
"With poorly chosen ""comedy"" moments that consist mainly of shouting and action elements that are mainly noise and smashing, this sequel misses every chance to come together in a satisfying way."
"Not much has been fixed since the original film and this sequel continues to make mostly the same mistakes and successes. Forgettable fun can certainly be had, but this one stings a bit more with so much misused talent and lost potential."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage C felt like a true, comic book, and we were plopped into a day of Eddie Brock's massive screw-ups.#diandrareviews"
"Sitting at ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" you quietly ask yourself, ""What have I done wrong? Is God punishing me?"""
"The character of Venom is neither funny nor scary, and he's one of the least compelling comic book characters going."
"I feel like [the filmmakers] knew where the endgame was going -- it's, ""All right, Venom and Carnage need to fight"" -- but they didn't know how to get the two there in a way that was actually pretty interesting."
"Much like Evil Dead II, Venom 2 takes what works about its shaggy predecessor, turns it up to 11 and gives it almost exclusive focus, and exponentially increases the silliness. And the results are deeply, charmingly dumb."
"Venom is so consistently laugh out loud funny that my only real complaint about the film is that their vaudeville act gets interrupted by relationship problems and Harrelson's own monster, Carnage."
"1st Venom was a fun surprise, but this is just more of the same. When the end credit scene is the most exciting thing about a movie, that says a lot... Hardy is still great."
"This is all nonsense, all the time, and everyone involved is finally on the same page as to how silly and stupid and fun this should be."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage ... remains indecisive about the character but is decidedly, safely, and tediously routine."
"Ultimately, the movie felt rushed. What was also lacking in the storyline, unfortunately, overshadowed some of the movie's better moments."
"A mind-numbingly tiresome sequel, filled with uninspired comedy and a CGI monster fight that seems to drag on forever."
The sequel far surpasses the original by leaning into the comic elements.
"Doesn't have that sense of joyful discovery and gleeful mischief that the first film did, because it's obviously now a comedy on purpose. But the Venom/Eddie dynamic remains the best buddy action comedy going these days."
Finds a way to quickly annoy the viewer... anyone other than diehard fans will be quite pleased when the movie is over in 90 minutes.
"I'll give director Andy Serkis credit, where instead of turning away from the formula, he instead doubles down, turning the weirdness up in Venom: Let There Be Carnage."
"It's short, cheap looking and maybe made for 8-year-olds. It's only fun if your idea of fun is being screamed at by a demon voice while staring at a mishmash of special effects for an hour and some change."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage knows exactly what it wants to be, shows up, and then ends before it gets overly long. While not a great movie, it's much more tonally consistent than the first one and leans into the things that worked."
The fine actors onscreen are mere accessories to the computerized puppets thrashing and slashing and stabbing and biting and roaring and breaking stuff all over the place before only one of them is left standing. Sigh.
"Everyone's in on the joke in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and it's more of a bummer than I could have imagined."
The picture's stylistic excesses... leave the viewer feeling pulverized by the time the closing credits roll.
"Rather than really make an effort to change things, the production clearly saw the previous movie's success as validation of its bad choices, so it regularly succumbs to many of the same issues..."
"By the end of it all - and what a rough, inconsequential ending it is - it's evident that the filmmakers have no idea what to do with these characters."
The real carnage was the friends we made along the way.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage' gives the people what they want - a slapstick superhero comedy that cites 'The Odd Couple' as inspiration.
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is still excessive junk, but it's fun trash. It seems to know what it is and emphasizes the most fun aspects of this franchise. You could do worse than watching Tom Hardy go wild for 90 minutes."
"A goofy superhero film that, despite flaws, makes for a fun comedic time at the movies and is an improvement upon the bloated first entry."
A showcase for Tom Hardy's surprising comedic gifts and little else. This is a middling movie made special by its central performance and willingness to be in on the joke.
It's the worst movie Tom Hardy ever made. It's the worst movie Woody Harrelson ever made. And it's the worst movie Michelle Williams ever made.
"Silliness was the first film's strength, which everyone involved seems to have realized and leaned into hard for the follow-up."
"Venom Let There Be Carnageis bombastic, funny, action-packed, silly, and at times, jarring- creating a fun, yet uneven, experience. A popcorn movie in every sense of the word."
I can't remember the last time I watched a comic book movie that was so light on its feet.
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is just as fun and silly as its predecessor. The lack of character development for Frances, Mulligan and Cletus hurts the climax, but the Venom and Eddie relationship drama builds nicely on the first film"
"Let There Be Carnage is a better version of what they were trying to do with the original. There's more of what was fun about Venom, but it also adds a more compelling villain, tonal consistency and efficient storytelling."
"It's almost too short, with too little interaction between Venom and the supporting cast, but it delivers plenty of campy violence and metaphorical Hardy & Hardy rom-com hijinks."
"With something so breathlessly paced, unpretentious, and goofy, it seems like a throwback to before the comic-book movie formula-or, rather, mode for easy-lay respectability-was patented by Marvel."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage has much more success making you laugh than it does thrilling you. It's not good, but it is a decent amount of fun."
"If you like your comic book characters murky, misshapen, and magnificently deranged, Tom Hardy's Venom is one nasty piece of work."
"Waste absolutely no time getting to the action, horror, & comedic antics of Hardy's Venom/Eddie. Harrelson is a scene stealer as Carnage, ending credits leaves many questions!"
What a difference a bit of tonal consistency can make.
"Doubling down on every wacky aspect of the first film that worked, this is a sequel that lacks the identity crisis of its predecessor."
The story otherwise is surprisingly mediocre...and seems to have excluded an entire middle chapter where we could get the most out of Woody Harrelson as the ultra-violent Carnage.
"Yes, Venom 2 is better than the first Venom, but then so are trips to the dentist."
"If brevity is indeed the soul of wit, at a tidy less-than-90 minutes, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is on point for what it largely is - a violently slapstick domestic sitcom."
"Ugly, cheap and dumb-but-not-good-dumb, the film is a throwaway kind of trashy nothingness."
A not-so-marvelous sequel.
"A sequel whose title is both a promise and the premise, in its entirety."
"This sequel inhabits the same comfortably dumb space as its predecessor. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one."
"It's a stuffed 90 minutes during which you'll sit in dumbfounded awe at the manic, fast-paced film you're watching."
"To simultaneously be outlandishly hysterical, surprisingly sweet and bafflingly middling is quite the feat - something this sequel achieves."
"it's not the promised spectacle that cements ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" as touching, wild entertainment. It's the themes of home, love, and companionship that make Serkis' sequel another reason to want more ""Venom"" movies, and quickly."
"Carnage is for the most part, in ways that count, another dirtbag delight. It's a lesser movie than Venom, but one that scratches many of the same itches and then some."
It's hard to overstate just how much the relative success of this film comes down to Hardy and his go for broke performances as Eddie and Venom.
"There doesn't need to be carnage (or, hell, even Carnage), there just needs to be Venom, and more of it."
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a movie you might enjoy if go in with low expectations. Like the first Venom, there will definitely be people who love and defend the sequel, but we at ComicBook.com are not among them."
"Let There Be Carnage is consistent with the first film when it comes to the humor, but it amplifies the madness and symbiote-centric action. Carnage brings a ton of chaos with him, and this one is a ton of fun."
"The possibilities are truly endless and, if the mid-credit sequence is suggestive of anything, Carnage is really just the beginning of what Hardy is going to do. Get excited, the lethal protector may be here to stay for a while."
"Let There Be Carnage doubles down on the same silly ridiculous humor from the first film. The visuals are stunning, giving fans some epic Carnage/Venom fight scenes."
"Now, here's ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" a sequel that does away with any pretext of seriousness.Like ""Evil DeadII,"" this is an off-the-wall, over-the-top, ""ThreeStooges"" inspired freak show."
"It's exactly what you want out of a film: a fun time without chest-beating moralistic, bloated stories, or perfunctory action. On these, Venom: Let There Be Carnage delivers as the odd-couple, campy-action ride we were promised."
"Though it will please most fans of the 2018 first installment, Carnage proves that superhero fatigue applies to nonheroes as well."
Tom Hardy decided to burn everything to the ground that makes a franchise successful and use the ash to formulate a new kind of offbeat formula that will make him equally famous.
"Venom as a series is working through its growing pains, but it looks like it's uphill from here."
A CGI feast of effects both visual and aural that ought to satisfy those who want to submit to it.
"When the film meanders into plot and motivation for the supposedly bigger, badder, and broodier new villain, it oozes into an unforgivably dull quagmire."
A pile of monster mush that should have been left in the lab.
"Tom Hardy's ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" franchise continues to be a flopsweat CGI eyesore and a ridiculous mess."
"Overseeing it all is Serkis, who understands the technology required to get the necessary virtual performances better than almost anyone, but demonstrates almost no vision as a director."
"Too much of ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" plays like a child bashing action figures together more than true mano-a-mano showdowns that stoke suspense and excitement."
Let there be lots more carnage.
"If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. It's not a huge leap in quality but it's still fun, especially when focusing on the Eddie/Venom relationship."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage delivers some more of what works - Eddie and Venom's dynamic - though everything around them remains quite messy.
"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the ultimate Marvel movie; seeing Venom and Carnage clash is a comic book fan's dream come true, but the epic action is bolstered by incredible visuals, some big laughs, and a surprising amount of heart."
"If you liked the first film, especially the humorous moments then you will get what you are expecting for the most part."
